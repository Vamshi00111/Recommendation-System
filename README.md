# Movie Recommendation System
A movie recommendation system that uses Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, and scikit-learn to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and predict movies they are likely to enjoy.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Based on user ratings and preferences, the system recommends movies.
Data-Driven Insights: Uses machine learning to analyze movie data and suggest content that matches the user’s taste.
Scalable: Can be expanded with more data or new recommendation algorithms.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for data processing and model development.
TensorFlow: Used for building and training the recommendation model.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
scikit-learn: Machine learning library for building recommendation algorithms.
SQL: Data storage and management (for storing user and movie data).
Matplotlib: Data visualization for presenting results.
